# Project Osszz

Project Osszz is an ambitious framework designed to enable network agents that Large Language Models (LLMs) can call upon to assist in solving complex problems. This project will be released component by component, each building towards the complete framework.

## Current Component Release: LLMObjects

The first component of Project Osszz is **LLMObjects**. LLMObjects provides seamless integration of Langchain model objects without requiring code changes. This component lays the foundation for linking various LLMs to network agents, enhancing their problem-solving capabilities.
